<h4>Linux File System</h4>
<p>Hierarchical Tree Structure. Root folder comes first and then files are under root respectively.</p>

<h4>Linux File System Overview:-</h4>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li>/ or /root: root user's home directory which is separate from other users</li>
        <li>/home: contains home directories of all non-root users.</li>
        <li>/bin(stands for binaries): executables for most essential user commands(all files are system-wide usable)
            <ul>
                <li>What is binary? <br>
                    Computer readable format (just 0's & 1's)
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>/sbin(system binaries): essential system binaries, programs that admin would use(need superuser priviledge)</li>
        <li>/lib, /lib32, /lib64, /libx32: essential shared libraries that executables from <strong>/bin</strong> <em>or</em> <strong>/sbin</strong> use.</li>
        <li>/usr(user): this was used for user home or directories(contains the same /bin, /sbin, /lib folders).
            <ul>
                <p><strong>Why /usr contains these folders?</strong></p>
                <li>historic reasons(as UNIX also had those splits)</li>
                <li>Because of storage limitations it was split to root binary folders ad user binary folders.</li>
                <li><strong>Note:-</strong> When we execute basic linux commands they are executed from /usr/bin folder</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In other distros, /bin or /sbin contains less commands & /usr/bin or /sbin contains all other commands. <br>
                Inside /usr, there is a folder /local which also contains same files as /usr(/bin or /sbin or /lib).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>/usr/local:
            <ul>
                <li>programs that you install on the computer.</li>
                <li>third-party applications like docker, minikube, ..... goes here.</li>
                <li>programs installed here will be available for all users on the computer.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Note:-</strong> If you want to install third-party applications & don't want to be accessed by all the other users then you install them in your own /home directory.</p>
        </li>
        <li>/opt(optional): third-party programs you install(all programs will be available system-wide).
            <ul>
                <p><strong>Difference</strong> between /usr/local & /opt:-</p>
                <li>/usr/local: programs which splits into its components.</li>
                <li>/opt: programs which not splits into its components.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>/boot(booting): contains files required for booting.</li>
        <p><strong>Note:-</strong> Till now all folders are Read-Only folders.</p>
        <li>/etc(et cetera): place where configuration for system-wide applications is stored.
            <ul>
                <li>orginally for etc(means everything else goes there).</li>
                <li>emerged into main configuration location.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>/dev(devices): location of device files- like webcam, keyboard, hard drives, etc. Apps and Drivers will access this, <strong>NOT</strong> the user.</li>
        <li>/var(variable): contains files to which the system writes data during the course of its operation.
            <ul>
                <li>/var/log:- contains log files.</li>
                <li>/var/cache:- contains cached data from application programs.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>/tmp(temporary): temporary resources required for some process, kept here temporarily.</li>
        <li>/media(removable media): contains subdirectories where removable media devices inserted into computer are mounted. <br>
            Eg; when you insert a CD, a directory will automatically be created & you can access the contents of the CD inside the directory.
        </li>
        <li>/mnt(temporary mount points): historically, sys admins mounted temporary file systems there(or manually mounting folders).</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h4>Interacting with these folders:-</h4>
<p>Usually you are not interacting with these folders. Installing apps with package manager(Installer or package manager is handling this).</p>

<h4>Hidden Files:-</h4>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>It is primarily used to help prevent important data from being accidentally deleted.</li>
        <li>Automatically generated by programs or operating system.</li>
        <li>File name starts with "."(dot)</li>
        <li>In UNIX, it is also called 'dotfiles'.</li>
    </ul>
